# point_spec_dev

Code to get the spectra graph from three devices: ASD3, ASD4, and SVC.

SVC has different file format than the ASD3 and ASD4. Run svc_format2ASD.R to convert it to a similar file format as ASD.

The output graph (.png) file will have the same name as the input file (like all.txt or all_reflect.csv will have output as all.png or all_reflectance.png).
